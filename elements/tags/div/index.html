	<h1><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></h1>
	<p>A block level element with no semantic meaning at all.</p>
</header>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>For lack of a better analogy, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> are the blue jeans of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> world.
They are incredibly versatile, nobody looks down on you to wearing/using them, and quite often 
they are the only thing that gets the job done.  </p>

<p>The <abbr>W3C</abbr> discourages their use:</p>
<blockquote>Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div element as an element of last resort, 
	for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div 
	element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say don't take too much stock in that. It's a bit like environmental groups saying 
	<q>We discourage the use of gasoline. When available, use alternatives in fueling you car.</q>
	It's true, but the cases where you cannot use the reccomended solution outnumber those where you 
	can. So don't let that drive you to picking obscure elements to avoid a  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.  
	Just make sure you think about it a moment before you do.

<h2>Conflicting or Confusing Elements</h2>
<h3><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element gets confused for a generic element from time to time. Especially 
since before people cared about semantics, it was used that way. It's simple, if it is a paragraph, 
then use a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, otherwise, you can use a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></h3>
<p>A <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is a generic inline element, not block level.</p>
