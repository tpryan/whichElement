<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Aside is a concept from theatre where a character will speaks to the audience about the 
narrative of the scene, but has no impact on it.  The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> is extra information
about the content, but doesn't impact the content at all. If you take it out, you can still 
perfectly understand the main content. </p>
