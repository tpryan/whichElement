					<h1><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></h1>
					<p>An article represents as stand-alone piece of content.</p>
				</header>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<aside>If you are using the words "entry," "post,"
					or obviously "article" to refer to the content in other places, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is for you.</aside>
				<p>An <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is meant to denote any pice of content that could stand on it's own.  The 
					most perfect example of this is a blog post.  A blog post although part of a larger site
					is a single consumable chunk, and does not require any of the rest of the content on the site
					to be something that one would be interested in. If you are using the words "entry," "post,"
					or obviously "article" to refer to the content in other places, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is for you. </p>
					
				<p>However you are not restricted to those uses.  "Standalone" can mean a fair number of things.  For example
					are comments appropriate for <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>?  At first glace no, but if you allow direct 
					linking to them via anchors, then it can be reasoned that you could count a comment as standalone
					and therefore appropriate to deal with as an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.   </p>	
				
				<h2>Conflicting or Confusing Elements</h2>
				<h3><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Anything that can be referred to by <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> 
					can work as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. In this case <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is less specific 
					then <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. </p>
				<h3><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>These two tags were both added in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Langauge 5">HTML5</acronym>. 
					That timing alone has seemingly caused some confusion. The important thing to note here: a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>
					refers to groups of related pieces of content, where an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> refers to a a single piece of 
					stand-alone content. So if the content is solitary, chose <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> over <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.   </p>
