<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Quotes are something someone else said.  This separates them from <a href="/concepts/pullquote">Pull Quotes</a> which 
are something you said, just fluffed up to look bigger.  That difference being established, there appear to be 2 main ways 
of dealing with quotes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Short Quotes</li>
	<li>Long Quotes</li>
</ol>
<p>Short quotes are quotes that you refer to inside the rest of your copy.  They make up part of the 
	paragraph, and don't interrupt it. They tend to be a sentence or less.</p>

<p>Long quotes are quotes that you break the flow of your content to show.  Instead of just referring 
to it, you are basically asking the reader to consider it with context.  They tend to be a paragraph or longer. </p>	



<h2>Candidates</h2>
<!-- A list of elements that might be the right fit. -->
<ul>
	<li>Not specified.</li>
	<li><a href="/elements/aside"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/blockquote"><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/q"><code>&lt;q&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Short Quotes</h3>
<p>My instincts tell me that most people don't markup inline short quotes. A short little test of some 
well respected newspapers, bore this out. (I picked news as they are fastitdious about quoting. ) Most sites
just use quotation marks. Probably due to a long historical lack of browser styling for this tag 
in Internet Explorer. It was added in Internet Explorer 8. So <code>&lt;q&gt;</code></a> wins this easily. </p>

<h3>Long Quotes</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element has a long history of being misued presentationally to indent content.
Because of that the actual purpose may have taken a backseat for awhile. For the most part, this is showdown between
not marking it up at all, and using the semantic tag.</p>
<p>However the addition of the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag opens up the door for some confusion, as it is often used
	for <a href="/concepts/pullquote">pull quotes</a>. Pull quotes and regular quotes sometimes get confused. So one might think 
	to stick a long quote in an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>. Easy rule of thumb here, if you are highlighting something 
	<em>someone else</em> said, use <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>. </p>
	
<h2>Verdict</h2>



<h3>Short Quotes</h3>

knowingly or unknowingly dressed as a marsupial, he
