	<h1>Pull Quote</h1>
	<p>A pull quote is a fluffed up copy of a bit of the content on the current page.  It's usually bigger and more visually 
		distinctive then the rest of the body copy.</p>
</header>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A pull quote in most cases is used to emphasize a theme or point of a piece.  The idea is that by presenting 
	this block quote, readers can determine more quickly if they want to read the piece. It's a stylistic addition 
	to a page that emphasizes content without actually adding concrete content.  </p>

<h2>Candidates</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/elements/aside"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/blockquote"><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li>Highlighted with CSS and HMTL5, no semantic reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first issue to clear is <q>Is this a <a href="/concepts/quote">quote</a> or a pull quote?</q> An easy rule of thumb here is 
	<q>If you are repeating something that is on this exact page, it's pull quote.</q>  Since it is not a quote, 
	<code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> is inappropriate.</p>
</p>	
<p>The <abbr>W3C</abbr> specifically points out in their definition of <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> that is intended 
for pull quotes:</p>

<blockquote>The element can be used for typographical effects like <strong>pull quotes</strong> or sidebars, for advertising, for groups of nav elements, and for other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page.</blockquote>
	<figcaption>Emphasis added</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That should be an open and shut case. Shouldn't it?</p>
<p>However Maykel Loomans makes a great case in his article 
	<a href="http://miekd.com/articles/pull-quotes-with-html5-and-css/">Pull Quotes with HTML5 and CSS</a> that 
	pull quotes are a display issue and not a content issue.  If you buy into it, it means adding extra markup, 
	and repeating content just to show a pull quote is semantically wrong. He makes a compelling case for it, and 
	has an awesome solution.  Just using HTML5 and CSS to style a pull quote.  The article is great reading.  	
</p>	
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>The semantic nit picker in me loves to point to <strong>Highlighted with CSS and HTML5</strong>. It might be a little 
	kludgy on the CSS side but
	from a semantic and content point of view, it's very elegant.  
	That being said, the <abbr>W3C</abbr> says you can use
	<code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> which might be a bit more flexible in terms of stying.
