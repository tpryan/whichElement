	<h1>Comment</h1>
	<p>An audience provided response to a piece of content on the web. </p>
</header>

<aside>This entry refers to an indivdual comment on a blog.  For the list  that 
	contains this item see <q><a href="/concepts/comments">comments</a></q></aside>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When we refer to comments, typically requires 2 things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A response to the main content</li>
	<li>An identifier for the author of the response.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then there are optional pieces of content:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>A website for the author of the response. </li>
	<li>Timestamp for the response.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Candidates</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/elements/article"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/span"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Right off the bat, I think we can nix the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. 
	The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> should not contain other block-elements which 
	precludes it from containing the members of a comment. Which makes you 
	have to use a lot of custom CSS to get the tags you can use in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
	layout the appropriate way for a comment. </p>
<p>Much the same way, this precludes the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> as it cannot contain 
	block-elements either, which makes for a lot of CSS hoop jumping. </p>
<p>Up until recently, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> would be your goto tag for a comment. As 
	it can contain block-level elements, can be styled without too much drama, and is
	specifically for holding information that isn't semantically designated any other way.
	It's a good choice. </p>
<p>The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is also a great candidate. But, it denotes standalone content. 
	At first glace this would seem to preclude using it. However, comments are often 
	deep linked.  This makes it seem like there is value in directly going to a comment 
	and bypassing the original content. In this case, the comment can be looked upon as standalone
	and deserving of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.</p>
	
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>We recomend the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.</strong>
	The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> can also work, but the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is the better 
	semantic choice.</p>
