	<h1>Title</h1>
	<p>The title of a book, movie, poem or some other content. </p>
</header>




<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When you make a reference to the work of another person, regardless of form, it is customary to call out that reference. 
In the print world this was done by italicizing, wrapping in quotes, or underlining. </p>

<h2>Candidates</h2>
<ul>
	
	<li><a href="/elements/cite"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/em"><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/q"><code>&lt;q&gt;</code></a></li>

</ul>

<p>Both the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and the  <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements are concerned with the display aspect of a
title, and not the semantic qualities. Neither one are sematically correct, it's not a quote, and it's not being
emphaisized.  Therefore both of these are poor choices.</p>

<p>However, the cite tag is actually very appropriate.  As you are citing some other work. However, this does
cause people to argue over the semantics of <q>cite</q>. Is just a passing reference worthy of a <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>?
To quote the <abbr>w3c</abbr>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The cite element represents the title of a work (e.g. a book, a paper, an essay, a poem, a score, a song, a script, 
a film, a TV show, a game, a sculpture, a painting, a theatre production, a play, an opera, a musical, an exhibition, 
a legal case report, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just 
be a work that is mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>
	<cite><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-cite-element">w3c -> The Cite Element</a></cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To paraphrase them - <q>Yes!</q> 
	
	
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>We recomend the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element.</strong>
	This one was pretty easy.  This is one of the most clearly defined usage in the <abbr>w3c</abbr>.
