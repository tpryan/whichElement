<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>It's seems straight-forward, there is an element named <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>.  Case closed right?
It's not so simple, the spec has something to say. </p>



<h2>Candidates</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/elements/address"><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li>A collection of <a href="/elements/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/elements/span"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a> elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance it would seem <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> would be the right choice, it's called <em>address</em> for goodness' sake.  But alas, as per the specification, address in the context of an <abbr>HTML5</abbr> element <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> means <q>To whom should I <strong>address</strong/> my issue with this piece of content.</q> So in this case it is referring to the authors of the article or the maintainer of the page.  If in that context, a postal address makes sense then you can use it, otherwise postal addresses should be otherwise marked up.</p>
	
	
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>We reccomend a collection of <a href="/elements/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/elements/span"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a> elements because the spec clearly states <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> is not the correct element ot use.
