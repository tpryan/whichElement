	<h1>Calendar</h1>
	<p>A list of dates, orgainized chronilogically. </p>
</header>



<h2>Overview</h2>


<h2>Candidates</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/elements/table"><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="/elements/div">Multiple <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>'s </li>
	<li><a href="/elements/ul"><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></a> + <a href="/elements/li"><code>&lt;li&gt;</code></a></li>
	
</ul>

<p>The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is a good starting spot.  When we think of calendars, we think of a traditional grid of dates. 
And that is semantically just fine. Doing a calendar as a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> should be viewed as acceptable. Therefore
the idea of building a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>-like construct out of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s should be viewed as needless
work and semantically more vague. </p>

<p>On the other hand, semantically, a list could be viewed as also semtantically correct for this data.  This becomes more
true if you want to skip dates, or linearlize the display. In fact, often on mobile devices you do want to display this 
content differently, omitting extraneous data, and .  It's a little easier to layout a list like a table, then it is to 
layout a table like a list. </p>
	
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>We recomend the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></a> + <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</strong>
	The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is also correct, and perhaps more semantically correct. However when it comes 
	to coding and displaying, lists are easier, and sematically good enough.  </p>
