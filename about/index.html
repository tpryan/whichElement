			<h2>Why whichElement?</h2>
			<p>Before HTML5 figuring out which element to use in very specific cases has been a little bit of a challenge, but 
				pretty managable. Going forward with HTML5 there are many more elements.  Some of these elements are very obvious 
				in their usage, some of them much less so.  The idea here is to have a centralized place that explains these in 
				very clear langauge.</p>
			<p>However, one of the dangers of semantic discussions is that of perfection.It's the idea that somehow if content 
				does not perfectly match the intended purpose of an element then you are somehow an awful web denizen for using it. 
				That's not the philosphy here.  Here we want to explain simply what the element is for, how people are using it, and 
				provide info on any contorversies. We don't want to be the semantic police, or the arbiters of any arguments. 
				We want to help you make the best descisions about what code you want to write.</p>
