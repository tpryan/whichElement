whichElement is an attempt to have a single resource to answer the question: "Which element should I use."

We welcome community participation. Feel free to get in the game.

WEBFONTS
We use Typekit to deliver webfonts to the site.  Typekit fonts are ties to the domain of the hosting server.  
Currently we support the following domains:

* whichElement.dev
* whichElement.com
* 127.0.0.1
* localhost

To serve up pages with proper webfonts setup your development environment to support one of those hosts, or request 
additional host support.
